I have successfully developed and deployed the Interactive Loan Calculator Web Application using Python and Streamlit.
This application allows users to input their personal and loan details (such as name, age, deposit, interest rate, and duration) using a variety of input types like text fields, sliders, number inputs, toggles, and checkboxes.

The application dynamically generates results, including loan repayment schedules, summary dataframes, and multiple graphs to help visualize the financial details clearly.

The project has been deployed on Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed at the following live URL:

The complete source code is available on GitHub for reference and further improvements.
