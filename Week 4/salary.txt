Salary Structure:

- Monthly salary is the fixed amount paid to an employee every month.
- Annual salary is calculated as monthly salary × 12.
- Deductions include income tax, provident fund (PF), and professional tax.
- Net salary (in-hand salary) = Gross salary − Total deductions.
- Bonuses are additional payments and may be taxable.
- Example: If monthly salary is ₹50,000, annual salary = ₹50,000 × 12 = ₹6,00,000.
